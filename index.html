            &emsp; I am a former automotive master technician looking to get into the IT support field. As a Master technician I have 10 years of experience in meeting peoples service needs and diagnosing both mechanical and electronic hardware/software issues.  As much as I enjoyed automotive work the job has negatively impacted my quality of life and damaged my body, for this reason Iâ€™ve decided to change my career trajectory toward something less physically demanding and perhaps even offering an air-conditioned work space for the summers.
        </br>
            &emsp; To facilitate my new ambitions I have been studying for various Comptia and AWS certifications. I am always working to improve myself and go above and beyond what is required.
        </br>
            &emsp; I hope that find me to be a good fit for your team and look forward to hearing from you. I can best be reached by phone at (603) - 723 - 0620.
        </br>
        </br>
            Thank you for your time and consideration,
        </br>
